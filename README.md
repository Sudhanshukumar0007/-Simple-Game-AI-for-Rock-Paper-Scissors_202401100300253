The problem is about to create a famous game “Rock,paper and scissors”.This game have very simple rules yet it is very interesting to play with friend and its sometimes deciders between the friends or siblings like what should we do or get that was the fun part .Now let us head to the problem we have:
In this game we have two player in which each players have to choose one from “rock, paper or scissors”. The rules are very basic like let us assume two players playing this and define the rules.
Player 1: rock
Player 2: Paper
Then Player 2 wins..
The game follows these rules:
Rock beats scissors, Scissor cuts the paper, paper holds the rock 
And that is all about the rule and the problem we have.
Now we are going to create a random based AI game which plays this game with a player considering the above rules.

Here we are using random function of python by which AI Is going to get a random choice between 
“rock ,paper ,scissor and based on the predefined or obvious rules of this game we are going to declare the winner .
So firstly importing random function to use it .                                                                
Now getting random choice from AI and ask the player to enter his choice then based on rules defined we have to find out it’s a tie or AI wins or the player wins.
So that’s very basic methodology so let’s code and create this game.
